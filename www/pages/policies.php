About This Site:

I built this site as my submission for the University of Maryland <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/cyber-security-capstone/">Cybersecurity Capstone Project</a> at Coursera in October 2018. Hopefully it has no security flaws. I'll find out soon enough if it does.

Cookie Policy

To function properly, this site needs to place a cookie on your computer. This cookie is a small text file consisting of letters and numbers that lets the web server know when you have logged in with the correct password. Without it, this site just won't work at all, so please make sure that your browser is configered to accept cookies. I won't share cookie information with anyone else. <a href="https://www.aboutcookies.org/">Visit aboutcookies.org for more information about cookies.</a>

Email Policy

According to the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), any site that collects email addresses can only do so with the consent of users. As it happens, this site does not store <em>any</em> email addresses at all, except very briefly in order to send a confirmation email when you create an account or reset your password. Your consent to receive emails in both cases is implied.

At all other times, the site only stores a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function">cryptographic hash</a> of the address. This can be used to verify that you entered it correctly when resetting your password, but cannot be used to recover the original email address.

So in other words, except when you create a new account or reset your password, this site will not and <em>cannot</em> contact you by email. Please bear in mind that if you lose the ability to access emails at the address associated with your account, then you will no longer be able to reset your password and could lose access to all your messages.

Storage Policy

Messages older than one month are liable to be deleted at any time in order to save disk space.
